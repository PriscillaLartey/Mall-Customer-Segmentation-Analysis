## Project Overview

This project applies **unsupervised machine learning** (K-Means clustering) to segment mall customers based on demographic and behavioral features. The analysis bridges the gap between technical data science and actionable business strategy, providing clear segmentation profiles and strategic recommendations for retail operations.

**Key Achievement**: Identified 5 distinct customer personas with non-linear spending patterns, revealing that **income alone does not predict spending behavior**.

---

## Business Problem

Mall management needs to understand their customer base to:
- Optimize **tenant mix and floor space allocation**
- Design **targeted marketing campaigns**
- Improve **customer experience and retention**
- Identify **high-value segments and growth opportunities**

Traditional demographic analysis (age, income) fails to explain spending behavior. This project uses clustering to reveal the hidden patterns driving customer value.

## Dataset

| Feature | Type | Range | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|-------|
| **Age** | Numeric | 18-70 years | Customer age |
| **Annual Income** | Numeric | 15k - 137k GHS | Annual household income |
| **Spending Score** | Numeric | 1-100 | Propensity to spend (derived from behavior) |
| **Customer ID** | Categorical | Unique identifier | |

**Dataset Size**: 200 customers | **No missing values**

---

## Methodology

### 1. **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**
- Descriptive statistics and distribution analysis
- Feature scaling (StandardScaler) for distance-based algorithms
- Outlier detection and validation

### 2. **Clustering Algorithm: K-Means**
- **Optimal clusters determination**: Elbow method & Silhouette analysis
- **Number of clusters selected**: 5 (balance between granularity and business interpretability)
- **Distance metric**: Euclidean distance
- **Initialization**: K-means++ for stable convergence

### 3. **Cluster Profiling**
- Calculate cluster centroids (mean age, income, spending)
- Derive business characteristics for each segment
- Validate segment distinctness and business relevance

### 4. **Business Translation**
- Map technical metrics to business language
- Develop actionable recommendations per segment
- Design strategic implications (tenant mix, marketing, experience)

##  Key Findings

### 🔴 **Income ≠ Spending** (Non-Linear Relationship)

The strongest insight: **High income does not guarantee high spending.**

| Cluster | Income | Spending | Ratio |
|---------|--------|----------|-------|
| Cluster 2 (Affluent Prof.) | 86.1k | 81.5 | 1.00× (baseline) |
| **Cluster 3 (Young Enthusiasts)** | **26.1k** | **74.8** | **2.87×** (spend 3× their income ratio) |
| Cluster 4 (Practical Youth) | 54.3k | 40.9 | 0.75× |
| Cluster 1 (Steady Retirees) | 47.6k | 41.7 | 0.88× |
| **Cluster 5 (Selective Splurgers)** | **89.8k** | **18.5** | **0.21×** (spend 1/5 of income ratio) |

**Implication**: Motivation, lifestyle, and values drive spending—not ability to pay.

### Strategic Segmentation by Age

- **Younger (25-33)**: 63% of base | High engagement | Trend-responsive
- **Older (44-55)**: 37% of base | Value-focused | Stability-seeking

### Revenue Drivers

1. **Cluster 2**: Highest spend per customer (81.5/100) + solid size (22%)
2. **Cluster 3**: High engagement despite low income (growth potential)
3. **Cluster 4**: Largest growth segment if frequency increases (25% of base)

### Risk Factors

- **Cluster 3**: Over-extension risk (spending 3× their income ratio)
- **Cluster 5**: Untapped potential (high income, minimal spending)
